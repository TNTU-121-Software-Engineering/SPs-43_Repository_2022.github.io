title: "Slovakia handed Ukraine another self-propelled gun Zuzana 2"
Ukraine received another Zuzana 2 Howitzer self-propelled artillery installation from Slovakia.

This is reported by RBC-Ukraine with reference to the page of the Minister of Defense of Slovakia Yaroslav Nagy.

"We are happy to confirm that the seventh Zuzana 2 Howitzer has been handed over to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and is ready to protect innocent lives," he wrote.

The Zuzana 2 self-propelled gun is an upgrade of the previous version of the 155 mm Zuzana. Thanks to the barrel length of 52 caliber, the gun installation is capable of firing at a maximum distance of up to 41 km. The tower can rotate 360 ​​degrees, and thanks to automation, the number of crew members was reduced from four to three.

The howitzer also has an automatic loader, which allows you to fire in the MRSI mode - several missiles can hit one target at the same time.

It should be noted that earlier Slovakia and Ukraine agreed on the supply of eight Zuzana 2 artillery installations.

Ukraine received the first four self-propelled guns from Slovakia in August.
